  <h3>Who We Help</h3>
                <p>We help early-stage B2B startups in Web3 & AI monetize quicker and build more iteratively. Most startups we partner with are pre-revenue. They are also typically looking to enhance existing development capacity.</p>
                <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to help our partner startups find market fit, begin monetizing early, and reach profitability without the overheads of hiring an entire team. Our goal is to make reaching profitability possible for the equivalent cost of just one entry-level developer. We value being agile, lean, and pliable.</p>
                <h3>What We Do</h3>
                <p>We have a SDaaS (software-development-as-a-subscription) model, where we directly engage in product development, while also contributing to the sales process. We help ship products faster and begin monetizing a small subset of a target audience earlier. We work with your devs in 14-day agile sprints and hold weekly scrums with you on user feedback, sales strategies, and product development iterations.</p>
                <h3>What We Don't Do</h3>
                <p>We don’t replace the need for a dedicated development team. We’re not a dev shop. Instead, we provide additional engineering capacity to help ship iterations of your product cyclically and based on user insight. By doing so we can monetize a smaller subset of your target audience who have a burning need for your solution while we continue to ship better and more polished versions of your product over time.</p>            </div>
